# Gauss–Legendre quadrature #
This repository consists of the algorithm to compute integral using the Gauss–Legendre rule and the pdf paper explaining this algorithm.

coef_nodes.m - function which creates weights and coefficients

coef_nodes_test.m - tests the coefficients and weights for Gauss–Legendre quadrature and creates a CSV table with results

integrate_using_Gauss_Legendre.m - A main function that calculates integral

integrate_using_Gauss_Legendre_test.m - A few tests of integrate_using_Gauss_Legendre function compared with built in Matlab function

Gauss-Legendre.txt - true values of coefficients and weights
